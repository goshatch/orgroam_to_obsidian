# Convert org-roam files to Obsidian-ready markdown

This is a Ruby script that help converting a collection of notes created with [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) to a bunch of Markdown files suitable for being imported into an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault.

I hacked this together in a couple of evenings because I wanted to see if it made sense to start using Obsidian instead of Emacs for my note library.

## Requirements

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- Ruby and bundler

## Running the conversion

## Preparation

```sh
$ cp ~/.emacs.d/.local/cache/org-roam.db input/
$ cp -R ~/org-roam input/
```

The locations of `org-roam.db` and the `roam` directory above are provided as examples only. You can find the actual locations on your system by inspecting these variables in Emacs:

- `org-roam-db-location`
- `org-roam-directory`

Make sure to COPY these to your `input` directory, so that you have a backup in case things go wrong.

Next, you can either run it locally (you'll need Ruby and Pandoc) or via Docker.

### Locally

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/goshatch/orgroam_to_obsidian
$ cd orgroam_to_obsidian
$ bundle install
$ ./convert.rb
```

#### Specifying the root org-roam directory

The script needs to know your root org-roam directory in order to correctly figure out the file names for each note. By default, it will use the org-roam default, which is `~/org-roam`. If you have changed this, get the value from emacs by inspecting the `org-roam-directory` variable, and pass it to the script with a command line flag:

```sh
$ ./convert.rb --roam-root "~/org/roam"
```

### Docker

```sh
$ docker build -f $PWD/Dockerfile -t orgroam_to_obsidian:0.0.1 .
$ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/opt/orgroam-to-obsidian orgroam_to_obsidian:0.0.1 
```

After the conversion is complete, the generated markdown files will be under the `output` directory.
